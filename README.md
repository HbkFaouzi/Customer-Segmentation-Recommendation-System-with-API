# Customer-Segmentation-Recommendation-System-with-API

## PROBLEM
In this project, we explore the dynamic field of **online retail by analyzing a transactional dataset**from a UK-based retailer. This dataset records all transactions from 2010 to 2011. Our main goal is to enhance marketing strategies and increase sales through **customer segmentation**. We plan to convert the transactional data into a customer-centric dataset by creating new features that will enable us to segment customers into different groups using the **K-means clustering algorithm**. This segmentation will help us understand the unique profiles and preferences of various customer groups. Based on this, we will develop a **recommendation system to suggest top-selling products to customers** within each segment who have not yet purchased those items, thereby improving marketing effectiveness and driving sales growth.

## Goal
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation**: Clean the dataset by handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers, preparing it for effective clustering.
    
- **Feature Engineering**: Develop new features based on the transactional data to create a customer-centric dataset, setting the foundation for customer segmentation.
    
- **Data Preprocessing**: Undertake feature scaling and dimensionality reduction to streamline the data, enhancing the efficiency of the clustering process.
    
- **Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering**: Segment customers into distinct groups using K-means, facilitating targeted marketing and personalized strategies.
    
- **Cluster Analysis & Evaluation**: Analyze and profile each cluster to develop targeted marketing strategies and assess the quality of the clusters formed.
    
- **Recommendation System**: Implement a system to recommend best-selling products to customers within the same cluster who haven't purchased those products, aiming to boost sales and marketing effectiveness.
